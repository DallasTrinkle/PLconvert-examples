<p>
You have a sample of crystalline {{params.mat}}, with a band
gap of {{params.egap}} eV, which is doped $p$-type with {{params.dopant}}. On
average, the dopant atoms are far apart and you can neglect the
interaction between them. Take the relative dielectric constant to be
$\varepsilon_\mathrm{r, {{params.mat}} }$ = {{params.epsr}} and the effective hole mass to be $m^âˆ—_h$ =
{{params.effmass}} $m_e$. (These numbers may or may not be the same as
numbers reported online).
</p>
<p>
Use the hydrogen atom model to estimate the average distance $d$ of a hole
from its dopant atom in the ground state.

Your solution: $d$ = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.abohr" /> Angstrom.
