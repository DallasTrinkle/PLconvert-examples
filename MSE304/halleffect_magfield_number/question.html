Consider a rectangular strip (thickness $D = {{params.thickness}}
$ nm, length $L = {{params.length}} $ mm, and width $W =
{{params.width}} ~\mu$m) that is used as a Hall probe sensor on an
insulating substrate. The material used here has an electron
concentration of {{params.atpervol}} $\cdot 10^{22}$ electrons/cm$^{3}$. A current $I = {{params.current}}$ mA is passed
through the probe along $L$, perpendicular to the cross-sectional area
$WD$. The magnetic field B is measured in the $z$ direction. A voltmeter is connected across the width $W$ to read the
Hall voltage $V_H$.

How large of a magnetic field do you need to measure a Hall voltage of {{params.voltage}} $\mu$V?
